# EzVersion
A very simple local versioning system for any files or directories. :)
Copies all files of the current directory, zips them and maps them to a tag.

EzVersion is not meant to be a replacement for git, but it's meant to be a very simple, 
easy to use and lightweight tool to document changes of any kind of folder structure or of
just  a file (without having the repository overhead)

Stop adding "very_final_last_rework_99999" to your file endings and start using EzVersion :D
